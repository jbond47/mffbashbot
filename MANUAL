Harrys My Free Farm Bash Bot
----------------------------

MANUAL
------

Basics
------
This bot will basically do something for you, after you've started something.
The idea is to support the player play the game, not to automate everything.

The bot doesn't care about the player making mistakes.
If you want to seed corn, but don't have enough corn in stock, the bot will
try to fulfill your request. This will (in this case) fail. That particular
station won't be served any further until the player corrects the mistake and
restarts that station.

When you buy or change any building, you'll have to relogon using the "Back to
logon" button. Otherwise the change can't be reflected with the GUI.

If a station has multiple slots, only those will be served that aren't rented
using coins. Exceptions are the speed eating, the wind mill and the pony farm.

Missing or superfluous queues on normal farms can be added or deleted by using
the 'Correct queue numbers once' option.

My bot hardly loses its cool. Meaning that if a station can't operate normally,
the bot won't stop entirely. Typically, only the faulty position stops but
the rest keep on working as expected.


Starting the bot
----------------

The bot needs to be started in the bot's program folder using this syntax:
mffbashbot.sh farm-logon-name

Password, server-no. & language have to be set in config.ini within your
farm folder.

A start procedure might look like this:
harry@testbox:~$ cd ~/mffbashbot
harry@testbox:~/mffbashbot$ ./mffbashbot.sh farm0815

Or like this:
harry@testbox:~$ cd
harry@testbox:~$ ./startallbots.sh

The bot can handle multiple farms. The 'screen' program can help you operate
multiple farms on one screen. Find info on what 'screen' is and how to use it
on the internet.
My ~/.screenrc looks like this:
---
hardstatus alwayslastline
hardstatus string "%{.bW}%-w%{.rW}%n %t%{-}%+w %=%{..G} %H %{..Y} %m/%d %C%a "
---
Starting multiple farms may look like this:
harry@testbox:~$ screen -t FarmName1

then, in the screen shell...
harry@testbox:~$ cd ~/mffbashbot
harry@testbox:~/mffbashbot$ screen -t FarmName2 ./mffbashbot.sh FarmName2
harry@testbox:~/mffbashbot$ screen -t FarmName3 ./mffbashbot.sh FarmName3
harry@testbox:~/mffbashbot$ ./mffbashbot.sh FarmName1

Switch between farms using CTRL-A, then the space bar.

The bots control elements (GUI in browser)
------------------------------------------

At the logon screen, it is determined how many farms there are defined under
~/mffbashbot. The discovered farms are then offered in a pull-down menu.

The GUI is pretty much self-explanatory (e.g. by mouse-over text).
A station is described as follows:
The pull-down menu at the top lets you choose items, that can be used at
that particular position. Underneath that, you can find the buttons used
to add or delete items to/from the queue, which can be found at the bottom.

Please note, that you need to fill in TWO text boxes with the stables.
The bot needs to know how many grain, corn, ... need to be fed.

"BOT START" forces the bot to end its pause (defined as PAUSETIME in the bot
script) and to start an iteration.


How the bot works
-----------------

Just to be sure: 
This bot will do something for you, after the player's started something.

The topmost element in a queue will be the next one to be served to that
position.

If the topmost element is "Sleep", the bot will leave that position alone. It
won't be harvested in that case either.

A single element in the queue gets repeated indefinitely.

Two or more elements in a queue also get repeated. After the topmost element
has been served, it moves to the bottom of the queue while the remaining items
all move one up.

You need to reach level four before fields can be cultivated by the bot.

The pony farm is controlled by only one queue. The bot will try to refill the
feeder after a hack. You can control pony energy bar usage via the options.
Mind that the max. number of pony energy bars will be added.

Automatic transportation off farms five/six leaves as many seeds
behind, that's needed to cultivate the current number of fields. So if you
have two fields on farm five, the bot would leave 120 grain seeds on farm five.
This behaviour cannot be altered without changing the code.
Auto-Transport off farms five/six is limited to the items that can be grown
there.

Auto-Transport TO farms five/six (can be found in Pondsville) takes place if
one of these conditions is met:
- The vehicles capacity is exhausted (exactly)
or
- All slots are in use
or
- The bot encounters a "Sleep" with at least one slot in use
CAUTION: If you overload the vehicle, it will stay on farm one!
If "Sleep" is the only item in the transport-queue, the vehicle gets sent back
emtpy.

Flower arrangements on display will be watered automatically, exept those
that don't need (any more) water.

The bot will take care of things to do for a running speed eating contest.
Rewards will be collected automatically as well as the cash desk bonus.

Animals treated at the veterinary clinic, will be cured automagically.
Only those tinctures are used, that don't cost coins and heal the quickest.
The veterinary clinic can NOT be auto-started.

Butterflies are fed automagically. Make sure you have enough food for the
animals, 'cause the bot won't. The feeding stops by you sending the butterfly
to the larger compound. Eggs are NOT bought automatically.

If you want to help produce stuff for a guild job, you first need to feed
or provide the proper goods from the guilds' stock to a position. After that,
the bot will notice that circumstance and treat that position as a guild job.
An exception is when you cultivate a field for the guild job. As long as you've
chosen the proper profession, the field will produce for the guild without
further intervention.

Required goods at the vehicle hall (mega field) will be worked on in a
left-to-right order. Fertilising machines can not be automated by the bot.
If your harvesting device uses up all its durability, the bot will try and buy
a new one. Careful: This might cost Coins!

The bot determines plucking-readiness of trees only by one single tree:
The top left one. That's why you can not have the bot plant different trees
in one go.

You may activate power-ups in Pondsville using two queues.

The farm name has to be unique. This means server independently unique.

The update handler only looks for a new version upon login from the GUI.
A re-login every now and then can be helpful.
